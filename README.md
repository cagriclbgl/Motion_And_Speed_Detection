# Motion Detection System with Speed Detection

This project implements a motion detection system using computer vision techniques. It allows users to choose between real-time motion detection via camera or motion detection from a video file. The system utilizes OpenCV for background subtraction, contour detection, bounding box visualization, and speed estimation of moving objects. Tkinter is used for the graphical user interface (GUI). The application supports both live camera feeds and pre-recorded video files, making it versatile for various use cases.

## Features

- **Real-time Motion Detection**: Detects motion in real-time using a webcam.
- **Video File Detection**: Allows the user to select and analyze motion in a pre-recorded video file.
- **Object Tracking**: Tracks and highlights moving objects using bounding boxes.
- **Speed Detection**: Estimates the speed of moving objects in meters per second based on their movement across frames.
- **User Interface**: Built with Tkinter to provide a simple and intuitive graphical user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language for implementing the project.
- **OpenCV**: Used for computer vision tasks such as background subtraction, contour detection, object tracking, and speed estimation.
- **Tkinter**: Used for creating the GUI (Graphical User Interface).
- **Git**: For version control and project management.
